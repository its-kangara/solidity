  ERC20 standard defines a set of functions to be implemented by all ERC20 tokens so as to allow integration with other contracts, wallets, or marketplaces. 
 
  
  
  six functions  tat makes up the ERC token .

function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256);
function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public view returns (uint);
function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender)
public view returns (uint);
function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool);
function approve(address spender, uint tokens)  public returns (bool);
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool);


Events defined by 

event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender,
 uint tokens);
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to,
 uint tokens);


added features in the ERC token 

string public constant name;  - name of the toke 
string public constant symbol; -  symbol or initials
uint8 public constant decimals; -  Decimal points say 8


public function means it can be accessed outside the contract itself 
view  or constant - the contract internal state will not be changed by the function 
Event - a way to notify frontend of the specif occurence with the contract .
