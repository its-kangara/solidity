The code is compliled to EVM = Ethereum Virtual machine 
Avalanche , fantom, Polgon 

import is like copy pasting our code in the new contract


Transactions in solidity consist of:

Nonce : tx count for the account
Gas price : price per unit of gas in wei 
Gas Limit : max gas that this tx can use 
To: Address
Value :  amount of wei to send

V, r , s :  components of the tx signature



 //to get the equivalent of USD to ether we introduce Oracles - they give us data in APIS
                                                                    //data from decentralized sources  eg .traditional agreement data (external data)
                                                                    //Chain link price feeds API

                                                                    //chainlink virtiual randomness numbers ( e.g lotery, NTFS 
                                                                    //Chainlink keepers  listens to diffrent event and charges gas 
                                                                    //End to end reliablity - make request to API's 
Calldata instead of memory saves gas. reduces copies
memory Read without saving to the blockchain
